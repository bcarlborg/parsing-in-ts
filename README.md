# Parsing in Typescript

This project implements basic top-down and bottom-up parsing algorithms in TypeScript. These implementations are not meant to be efficient or ready for production usage. I implemented these algorithms in order to get an intuitive understanding for how parsing works, because, you don't understand what you can't build.

The current version of this project includes two basic parsers, one top down parser and one bottom up parser. These parsers have essentially no optimizations. They implement the most naive brute force versions of parsing algorithms.

By learning how to implement the basic brute force versions, it is much easier to understand the optimiziations that make more advanced parsing algorithms like LL and LR parsing efficient.
