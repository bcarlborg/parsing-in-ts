# TODOS

_A simple list of todos that I use to remember where I left off. Buyer be warned, the items on this list may or may not be be up to date and may or may not ever be completed._

## Current TODOS

**refactors**

- [ ] In general, I am starting to like the approach for the DFS more and more, it feels a bit
      more clear, but I think it still is more complicated than it needs to be. I feel like
      there are interfaces that I can simplify.

**functionality**

- [ ] bottom up breadth first search
- [ ] bottom up depth first seach

**Code Structure**

- [ ] add better interface for debug logging (multiple levels of debugging maybe? a helper that outputs the filename too?)
- [ ] make script accept input args to run particular parsers and choose different output conditions
- [ ] make unused imports a lint error

**Observabillity**

- [ ] add abillity to measure runtime and memory usage
- [ ] create a performance test suite
